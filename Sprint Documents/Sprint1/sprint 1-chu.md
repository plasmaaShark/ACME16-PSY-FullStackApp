## Unfinished Work
https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/6
Progress: We have successfully run the web software locally from the previous team, but the automatic email functionality is still incomplete. We have made progress on connecting the PDF generator to our email system.
Reason: This task is taking more time than expected due to additional technical challenges with email server configuration.
Plan: We are moving this task to Sprint 2, where we plan to complete the remaining email functionality.

https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/19
Progress: Watching the "Learn MongoDB" course offered by Codeacademy.
Reason: Due to the complexity of the MongoDB course, we underestimated the time required to learn.
Plan: We will continue the course in Sprint 2.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Most of the issues in this sprint were documentation, and GitHub does not support merging documents. For issues related to our own documentation work, there will be no pull requests in most cases. Instead, when the documentation work is completed, everyone will upload their own documents to GitHub, and the team leader will integrate and submit them.
