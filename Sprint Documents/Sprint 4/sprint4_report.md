significant learnings for your team.
## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user
stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward
completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of
acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the
issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate
it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so
that it can be addressed later.
