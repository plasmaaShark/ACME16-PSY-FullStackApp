This is so that I could be more helpful for the people I surround myself with now and for the people I will meet in the future so that I can be more helpful.,My most important goal is to keep practicing soccer because I will be at Washington State University for at least three more years and I want to be able to join the soccer team as a walk-on. This can help me get back into the same passion I had for soccer when I played in high school before the pandemic hit and made it difficult to keep playing.,1,4,5,7,4,4,7,3,1,7,7,7,1,,,7,4,7,5,2,1,7,7,7,1,2,6,7,4,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,1,6,5,7,4,7,4,2,1,7,7,7,8,7,6,9,4,2,3,1,5,1,1,Jesenia Larios,Sean Cole,,,Eduardo Ochoa,Osvaldo Ochoa,,,Dustin Young,Austin Peart,Will Koenig,Ryan Schmahl,Joey Veliz,,,Jim Cunningham,Dustin Johnson,,,,,Jesenia Larios,Sean Cole,Dustin Young,Austin Peart,2,1,5,1,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,1,,1,1,5,1,5,3,3,5,3,3,2,1,1,5,1,3,2,1,1,5,3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,10,,1,1,5,1,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,1,1,5,1,5,1,1,1,5,5,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2,,1,1,5,1,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,1,1,5,1,5,1,1,1,5,5,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,2,,1,1,4,4,1,4,6,1,4,6,1,5,3,1,3,6,1,6,6,1,4,3,1,5,4,1,4,6,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,3,4,2,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,46.7314,-117.1733,-1
