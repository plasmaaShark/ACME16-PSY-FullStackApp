Completed work:
Qualtrics issue: Fixed the connection issue by confirming the correct token.
PythonAnywhere issue: Resolved API error in launching the console and successfully implemented automatic report generation and delivery.

Next steps:

1. Integrate all files into a web application in PythonAnywhere and test if everything works.

2. Fix the display problem of radar chart and improve the layout of PDF.

3. Walter mentioned that some scores in PDF feedback cannot be explained yet, and some score-based feedback language will be added in the future.

4. Belinda mentioned that they have a document containing explanations for different score ranges, which can be coded and put into PDF.

The goal is to implement radar chart before November 5 and further improve PDF report.

Walter mentioned that he just submitted a paper on personality assessment methods. If it is accepted, he hopes to include a link to this Qualtrics survey in the paper for his peers to use.
